# Accessible Elementor popups by Accessibility Zone
This is a small plugin that serves as an addition to the Elementor plugin. This plugin adds support for accessibility to popups.

## Usage
Just install and run, that's it! 
The only thing I would like to note is that the accessible popup is the one that contains the **close button** and **the title**!

### How to give a title to a popup
Just add the first heading element (Recommended h2-h4) to your popup flow which will describe the name of the popup! If your design does not meet these requirements, you can simply hide it from displaying and save it to Scree Reader programms, you need for this add the one of the classes: **az-sr-only**, **sr-only**, **az-popup-hidden-heading**. Also, this is not very correct, but you can add the **az-popup-heading** class to any element, which will be the title of this pop-up
